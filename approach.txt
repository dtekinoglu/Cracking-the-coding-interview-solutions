The approach shown can be boiled down into 4 main steps:

Clarify
  - Understand (0-3mins)
  - Ask clarifying questions, edge cases (3-8mins)
  - Specify assumptions (8-10mins)

Plan
  - Find a solution (10-20mins)
  - Explain your solution (15-20mins) 

Implement
  - Optimize (20-25mins)
  - Write the code (25-35mins)
  
Test & optimize
  - Test run your code (35-40mins)
  - Optimize your code (40-50mins): Explain time and space complexity
